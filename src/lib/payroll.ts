// Payroll has ONE reviewer stage, and it is finance: a filed request goes
// straight to valera@, who either declines it back to the filer or pays it.
//
// It used to pass through an admin stage (tech@/shakhzod@) that approved
// requests onward for payment. That stage is gone: nothing waits on a second
// desk, and no request is queued to an account that no longer reviews. What
// the admin stage contributed — a note explaining what to fix — is the same
// decline the reviewer still has, so nothing was lost with it.
//
// Env vars ADD reviewers (the ADMIN_EMAILS convention) — handy for exercising
// the queue as dev@freshman.academy locally, and the way to hand someone the
// desk for a week without a deploy. PAYROLL_ADMIN_EMAILS is no longer read by
// anything; PAYROLL_FINANCE_EMAILS is the one that still adds a reviewer.
//
// Being a global admin (lib/admin.ts) means seeing everything payroll holds —
// the panel, the stats, the invoices — but NOT acting on a request. Deciding
// money and administering the app stay separate, as they did before.

 * The deadline a decline at `now` leaves the filer, and whether it runs past

 * deadline — the cutoff their period closes on — and being sent back to fix a
 * note is no reason to shorten it. The old min(now + 24h, cutoff + 24h) did
 * exactly that: declining on the 27th handed back a deadline of the 28th and
 * quietly took days of runway off someone who still had the whole window. So
 * the ordinary case hands the cutoff back unchanged.
 *
 * The one exception is a decline ON the window's last day — the 1st of M+1,
 * where filingClosesAt sits, NOT the last day of the month itself (see
 * periodBoundsFor). A decline at 22:00 that day would leave two hours to redo
 * a whole pay request, so the deadline runs one day past the cutoff instead.
 * That is the grace day, and `usesGraceDay` reports it so the caller can spend
 * the once-per-period flag.
 *
 * "Last day" is a Tashkent calendar-day test, never a UTC one: 00:30 on the

 * would be judged against the wrong date — the exact hours a late-night
 * decline is most likely to land in.
 *
 * The result therefore only ever takes two values, cutoff or cutoff + 24h, and
 * as time passes it moves from the first to the second and never back. That is
 * what makes re-declines safe: a second decline can neither push the deadline
 * further out once the grace day is spent, nor claw back a deadline it already
 * granted — so the caller needs no `graceDayUsed` input to stay idempotent.
 *
 * This clock is the reason refiling a DECLINED request is NOT gated by the
