// Server-only: who may act ON whom. Assigning tasks, fining, and awarding

// powers over the people under them. "Under" means holding a MEMBER seat in a
// department the actor holds a LEAD seat in — a fellow lead of the same
// department is a peer, not a report.
//
// A lead may also act on THEMSELVES, but only for the two money powers (fine,
// bonus) — see `allowSelf`. Assigning is excluded: a lead adding their own
// task doesn't need this gate at all, they set their own goals from the
// dashboard, and keeping self out of the assign scope also keeps the
// dashboard's "assign to everyone" fan-out from silently including the sender.
