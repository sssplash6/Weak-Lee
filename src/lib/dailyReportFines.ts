// Proactive daily-report fining plus the evening nudge — the same lazy no-cron
// pattern as the weekly sweep (lib/submissionFines.ts) and the payroll
// reminder: everything runs on page loads and is idempotent.
//
// The rules (set 2026-08-19): a weekday's report is due by 5 AM Tashkent the
// next morning. Missing that costs $5; if the report still isn't in by 3 PM
// that same day, the fine becomes $10. Submitting between 5 AM and 3 PM keeps
// it at $5. Weekends are never owed, nothing before the fines epoch is ever
// fined, and at 21:00 Tashkent anyone who hasn't sent that day's report gets a
// reminder (in-app + email) — once per day, claimed by whichever page load
// gets there first.
//
// Idempotency is stronger here than the weekly sweep's createdAt-window trick:
// each fine carries the day it's for (Penalty.reportDay) under a database
// unique, so racing reconciles can't double-fine.
