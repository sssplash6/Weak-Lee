/**
 * The department panel for leads: the whole roster of every department the
 * viewer leads — the lead themself and any fellow leads included, so the list
 * reads as the actual team rather than "everyone except me" — with the lead's
 * three powers (assign a goal, fine, bonus) on the rows they apply to.
 *
 * Those powers do NOT extend to every row. A lead manages the MEMBER seats
 * under them, not themselves and not a peer lead, so each row carries a
 * `manageable` flag taken from lib/manage.ts — the same function the actions
 * re-check server-side, so the buttons can never offer what the action would
 * refuse. Admins have the wider /admin view; this is the day-to-day one.
